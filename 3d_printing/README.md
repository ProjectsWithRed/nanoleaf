# 3D printing

All the 3D printed parts used in this project.

- A segment is made up of two 3D printed parts, the housing and the lid.
- I recommend printing the lid in a white filament to reflect as much light as possible, however, black can also be used, as the difference is very minimal.
- Each segment requires roughly 75 grams of filament, 43 grams for the housing and 32 grams for the lid.

# 3D printing settings

- For the housing and lid parts, refer to `housing_lid_settings.curaprofile`.
- For the connector, refer to `connector_settings.curaprofile`.
